# Data & Analysis Materials for *Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education* manuscript

**Abstract:** The importance of data science skills for modern scientific
research cannot be understated. In recent years, we have begun to see policy
documents---arguing what data science acumen should be included in undergraduate
programs in statistics and data science. Yet, we have yet to see research
investigating how students learn these critical skills. This case study provides
an in-depth exploration of the learning progression of one environmental science
graduate student. By qualitatively analyzing the R code Alicia produced as she
progressed through her graduate program, this paper maps how Alicia's data
science skills evolved over time. The results offer a cautionary tale of how a
student's learning trajectory beyond their statistics classroom can be
influenced by the pedagogical choices of their instructor.

**This repository contains three folders of materials used / created when
analyzing Alicia's code.**

## Quantitative Data Analysis Files (stored in `code-changes` folder)

- `r-code-themes.xlsx`
  * Excel file with separate sheets for each R script
  * Each sheet contains the qualitative code assigned to each line of code and
  whether the code contained errors.
  
- `alicia-code-analysis.qmd`
  * Code to read in the `r-code-themes.xlsx` Excel file, clean the data, and
  create the visualizations included in the manuscript.
